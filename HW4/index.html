<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
    <li> I learned how to load a JSON file in Phaser, how to create multiple game states, how to implement my own mechanics, and how to load an animation</li>
    <li> The easiest part was the art, the hardest part was getting the JSON file and game states to work</li>
